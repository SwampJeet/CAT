The Consolidated Audit Trail (CAT) system was first discussed in the context of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2010. The SEC adopted Rule 613 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 
which mandated the creation of the CAT system. The primary goal of the CAT system is to enhance regulatory oversight and improve the ability to investigate and reconstruct market events, such as market disruptions and 
potential violations of securities laws and regulations. The CAT system is designed to collect and accurately identify every order, cancellation, modification, and trade execution for all exchange-listed equities and options 
across all U.S. markets.

The national securities exchanges and national securities associations listed under the CAT NMS Plan are responsible for developing, implementing, and maintaining the CAT system. 
This initiative was a response to the growing complexity and interconnectedness of the U.S. securities markets, 
which made it increasingly challenging for regulators to monitor and analyze trading activity effectively.

The CAT system is intended to provide a comprehensive and efficient means for regulators to track orders throughout their lifecycle and to identify 
the broker-dealers handling them. This allows for more efficient and accurate tracking of all activity in U.S. equity and options markets, 
improving the ability to investigate and reconstruct market events.

In 2024, there are several changes and new regulations related to the Consolidated Audit Trail (CAT) system. The most notable change is the implementation date 
for the CAT system, which is set for May 28, 2024. This system is designed to track orders throughout their lifecycle and to identify the broker-dealers handling them, 
which aids in regulatory oversight and transparency in the U.S. equity and options markets.

Additionally, the SEC has adopted rule changes to shorten the standard settlement cycle for most broker-dealer transactions from two business days after the
trade date (T+2) to one business day after the trade date (T+1). This change is set to take effect on May 28, 2024, coinciding with the implementation of the CAT system.

The introduction of the CAT system and the shift to a T+1 settlement cycle are significant changes aimed at enhancing regulatory oversight and improving the
ability to investigate and reconstruct market events, such as market disruptions and potential violations of securities laws and regulations. These changes are expected to 
provide regulators with more efficient and accurate tracking of all activity in U.S. equity and options markets.
